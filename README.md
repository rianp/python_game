This app allows two people to play a text-based version of the game [Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala).

For this board game, two players can play. As the figure shows, the player who choose the bottom red position will be player 1 and the player choose the top blue position will be player 2.  Each player can only choose the pit on their side in each round: player 1 can only choose pits in red and player 2 can only choose pits in blue. The index for each pit is marked in the figure as well.
